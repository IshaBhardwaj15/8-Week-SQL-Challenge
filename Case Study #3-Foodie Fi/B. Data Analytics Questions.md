#### 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql
select DATEPART(month,s.sstart_date) as month_number,
	   FORMAT(s.sstart_date,'MMMM') as month_name,
       COUNT(*) as trials
from foodie_fi.subscriptions as s
join foodie_fi.plans as p on
	p.plan_id=s.plan_id
where s.plan_id=0
group by DATEPART(month,s.sstart_date),
	     FORMAT(s.sstart_date,'MMMM')
order by month_number
```
